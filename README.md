# teamleadercrm-coding-test
A repo with one of the multiple possible solutions to https://github.com/teamleadercrm/coding-test/blob/master/2-ordering.md

>Note that this repo contains two different services, each with its own root folder
>
>
>- A client written in React under the folder `client`
>- A server pending to be written under the folder `server`
>
>We have decided to do it this way, because it's easier to operate using only one repo, and when it makes sense to split these two services into their own repos (if ever), we should just move the contents under these two different folders to their own repo.

You can find a proper README for both the [client](client/README.md) and the [server](server/README.md)

## CI
This repo uses travis-ci as CI server. You can see the builds [here](https://travis-ci.org/aspgems/teamleadercrm-coding-test-2)
